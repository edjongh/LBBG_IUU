This folder contains all information  about the project "MSc thesis E. de Jonghe; Potential of 
seabirds as animal sentinels for illegal fishing detection; a Lesser Black-backed Gull study"

The following subfolders and files are present:

- Readme.txt  (this file)
- Data
	+ An example dataset collected from one GPS tracking device attached to a gull. This
	  example dataset resembles the raw and derived data used for the project. 
	+ Derived summary (meta)data used for the final analysis steps.
- Code
	All the scripts used in the project. The scripts are fit to bird GPS datafiles 
	similar to the example dataset included in the "Data" folder. The scripts are used to
	analyse and subset GPS-tracks, to extract events from the GPS-tracks and to produce 
	the statistics, figures and graphs in the final report.
